(S'03--M'09--SM'14) holds a Diploma (2003) and a Ph.D. (2009) in Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science, both from the National Technical University
of Athens (NTUA), Greece. He is currently a Research Scientist at Google,
following appointments as Research Assistant Professor at the Toyota
Technological Institute at Chicago (2013-2014) and Postdoctoral Research Scholar
at the University of California, Los Angeles (2009-2013).

His research interests are in computer vision and machine learning, with a
current emphasis on deep learning. He regularly serves as a reviewer and
program committee member to the main journals and conferences in computer
vision, image processing, and machine learning. He has been a co-organizer of
the NIPS 2012, 2013, and 2014 Workshops on Perturbations, Optimization, and
Statistics and co-editor of a book on the same topic (MIT Press, 2016).
